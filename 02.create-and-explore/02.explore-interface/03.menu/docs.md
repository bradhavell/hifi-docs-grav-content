## Introduction

You can use the menu items in High Fidelity to load an avatar you created, to get a virtual pet from the Marketplace, and travel to different domains to meet your friends. 



###Audio

This menu item helps you control the audio output and input while you are in High Fidelity. You can select the device of your choice and also mute your audio. You can also select the correct input or output device for Desktop and VR mode, allowing for a smooth transition when you change modes.

###VR/Desktop

Selecting VR/Desktop will make you switch between your HMD and desktop. If you wish to experience High Fidelity in desktop mode, you can click the VR button, and if you're in Desktop mode, you click the Desktop button to switch. 



###Menu

This is the main menu which contains options for File, Edit, Audio, Avatar, Display, View, Navigate, Settings and Tools. You can use this menu to increase the size of your avatar, change your general settings, enable advanced movements for your hand controllers and much more.

###Bubble

High Fidelity respects your privacy. We've created the Bubble to ensure that no avatar can see you if they walk into your personal space while in VR. When you turn on the bubble, a bluish transparent sphere will be visible when an avatar nears your bubble.

###Snap

This particular menu item will help you take a snapshot in any domain. When you take a snapshot, you can save it on your system and share it in your feed. When you take a snapshot at a particular spot in a domain and share it, it is added to the GoTo thumbnail for that domain. Whenever someone wants to go to that domain, they arrive in the same spot as you by clicking the snapshot available in the GoTo menu.

###GoTo

GoTo helps you navigate to different domains and your home domain (or your sandbox). When you click GoTo, you can search for your domain by typing its name or you can look for places you want to visit. If you click on a snapshot of a domain, GoTo will take you the location where the snapshot was taken.

###Market

Market directs you to the marketplace, where you can get anything from a new avatar and a chair, to building blocks and even a virtual pet. Currently, everything in the marketplace is free. You can learn how to build and submit your creations to the marketplace [here](../../../marketplace).
