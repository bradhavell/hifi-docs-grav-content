## Create a Particle Entity

Go to **Create** and select the Particle icon.

## Properties

Particle entities have the properties common to all entities as well as additional particle specific properties.

To edit the particle entity, select the **Particle Explorer** tab. This is indicated by a small particle icon on the top-right hand corner of your tablet.

>>>>> The **Color** property appears in both, the **Properties** tab and the **Particle Explorer** tab. This is the same property. But, when you change the value in one tab, the value isnâ€™t updated in the other. it is reflected in both places only once you select another entity and then re-select the particle entity.
