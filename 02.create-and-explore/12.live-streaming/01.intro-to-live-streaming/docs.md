*A brief introduction to live streaming in High Fidelity.*

## Introduction

If you want to reach your audience through YouTube or Twitch, or your friends through Facebook Live, you can do so with the help of our live streaming guide for High Fidelity. 

Before you get started, you will need to download and install the following:

* [High Fidelity's Interface and Sandbox](https://highfidelity.com/download/sandbox) (if you haven't already downloaded the latest release).
* [Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com/) (recommended).

You can use the recording and streaming software of your choice. We recommend OBS and have included instructions for using OBS in this series as well. 

Ensure you have the permission to live stream through the channel of your choice. 



### Before You Start

Before you start recording and streaming, determine if this is a one-time event, or if it is a show or event, and the type of VR personality you'd like to have. 

Depending on your requirements, you can use your desktop, an HMD with or without controllers, or a [motion capture system](../..//explore-interface/menu/mocap-system). 



### Set up High Fidelity for Streaming

Once you've completed installing Interface, you can now use High Fidelity's new [Spectator Camera](https://docs.highfidelity.com/create-and-explore/marketplace-apps/spectator-cam) feature. 

You can set up OBS to stream your Spectator Camera's view.
