Learn to **create fireflies** using particle entities with a script and have them move within your environment. The resulting fireflies will randomly move within a tree.

The base script used in this tutorial can be found on GitHub: [FlockOfFish.js](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi/blob/master/script-archive/FlockOfFish.js)
