In this video, you'll learn the basics of how to create a mini-golf game in High Fidelity. Mini-golf is a fantastic hand-controlled VR experience to share with friends. Below, you'll learn to build a compound convex hull for a concave surface, as well as the basics on entity import/export, grabbable and equippable entities, scripted entities, and asset export from Maya LT and import into High Fidelity.

The mini-golf putter (with scripts) can be obtained by selecting the **Examples** icon in Interface and then selecting **Get** on the **MiniGolf Putter**.

The example script used in this tutorial can also be found on GitHub: [golfClub.js](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi/blob/master/scripts/tutorials/entity_scripts/golfClub.js)
