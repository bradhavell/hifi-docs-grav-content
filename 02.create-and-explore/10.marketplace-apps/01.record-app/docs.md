The Record app lets you record yourself and watch a bot replay the recording in a loop. You can use this app to record short videos of your avatar.

We’ll walk you through getting the app, setting it up and using it.



## Get the Record App

To get the record app, pull up your tablet and:

- Go to Home (your Sandbox).
- Go to Marketplace.
- Download the Record App.
- Click "Yes" for "Would you like to run this script."
- Pull up your tablet again.
- Open the new Record app.

## Before You Use the App

Before you use the record app, learn how to set up your assignment clients.

## App Menu

The following lists the menu items in the app and how you can use them.

- Recordings Being Played: This gives you the list of recordings currently being played in the domain.
- Unload: You can stop playing a recording using unload. Click “x” to stop playing a recording.
- Number of Available Instances: This is the number of assignment clients available to play a recording. When this number reaches 0, add more instances of playRecordingAC.js in your domain settings.
- i: This gives you information on how to set up assignment clients.
- Load: This will load a recording of your choice from ATP.
- Record: Starts recording.
- Stop recording automatically when reopen tablet or window: Check this if you want to stop recording as soon as you reopen your tablet. This would be particularly useful if you’re using an HMD.

## How to Create a Recording

Now that you know how the app works, its menu items and have set it up, you can start creating recordings. To create a recording, you have to:

- Click on Record.
- After a 3 second countdown, begin acting!
- Click Stop to finish recording.

Once done, your recording will replay right in front of you to see what it looks like!

The recordings you create are saved as a .hfr (High Fidelity Recording) file your domain’s ATP under the folder “recordings”.


### Load a Recording

You can click "Load" to load a recording you previously made from ATP.

### Rename or Permanently Delete a Recording

If you want to rename or permanently delete a recording, go to **Edit > Asset Browser** and find the recording under the folder “recordings”. Remember, once you delete the recording, you won't be able to view it again. Recordings use UTC time as their file names.
